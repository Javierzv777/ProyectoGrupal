<p>Application that allows common users to search for products, filter them
by name, price, category, have a list of favorites, and through a simple
registration make a purchase through paypal.
Once the purchase is made, a review system is enabled, where the buyer
can leave a comment and a rating for both the seller and the
publication.
Posts have a question and answer field where users can interact with
sellers.
All purchases and interactions of the client with the seller produce a
notification through emails, offering both the client and the seller to be
updated on the news of the page.
It also allows registered users to register as sellers by filling out a short
form and accepting the terms and conditions of the marketplace.</p>
